Surface roughness estimation in cylindrical plunge grinding

1 Background
Cylindrical plunge grinding machine is used in the aerospace industry to create smooth cylindrical
surfaces on components such as shafts and plungers. A general cylindrical grinding process has 4
stages namely roughing, nishing, semi-nishing and spark-out.

The following are the machine settings used in the dierent stages of the process
 In-feed rate (feed rate)
 Wheel speed (wheel speed)
 Work speed (work speed)
The in-process signals are collected using three dierent sensors. Two accelerometers and a power-
cell capture the vibration signals and power drawn by the spindle motor. The signals are collected
for every stage of the grinding process. A few statistical features are extracted from the signals which
should be used for building the current model to estimate surface roughness after each stage. The
following are the features in the present data-set.

Using power signals:
1. Peak power (peak power)
2. Mean power (mean power)
3. Standard deviation (std power)
4. Skewness (skewness power)
5. Kurtosis (kurtosis power)
6. Peak to peak value (p2p power)

Using accelerometer signals :
1. Peak (peak mag an, peak mag at)
2. Mean (mean an,mean at)
3. Skewness (skewness an, skewness at)
4. Kurtosis (kurtosis an, kurtosis at)
5. Total energy (total energy an, total energy at)
6. Energy band - 1 (energy band1 an, energy band1 at)
 Energy band - 2 (energy band2 an, energy band2 at)

2 Summary of the data-set
The data given contains 23 predictors (3 process variables + 6 features from power signal + 14(72)
from accelerometers) and a single response variable - Surface roughness (Ra).
